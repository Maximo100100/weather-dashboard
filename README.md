# [Weather Dashboard](https://maximo100100.github.io/weather-dashboard/)

This project was fairly challenging since I had no experience with 3rd party APIs but through alot of googling I was able to piece this together I found a few methods that I will definitely reuse. If I had to do it again I would have the documentation in front of me the whole time because alot of what I was trying to do has been done before and towards the end of the project I just created a huge headache for myself.

I dont think I could have put this together if not for all the open weather map tutorials on youtube.
